				<p>WASHINGTON -- President Obama plans to use Tuesday night's State of the Union address to call on Congress to pivot from an era of terror, war and recession to one of expanding economic opportunity, outlining a wide-ranging agenda intended to address income inequality and help working Americans.
				</p>
				<p>"Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well, or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?"" Mr. Obama will say, according to excerpts from the speech distributed in advance.
				</p>
				<p>Meeting a skeptical Congress on its own turf, Mr. Obama will press to capitalize on the economic recovery to achieve some of his long-held goals. He is expected to call on Republicans to work with him on potential areas of consensus, including a new push to approve far-reaching trade deals in Europe and Asia.
				</p>
				<p>But the president will also use the annual prime-time address to sketch an activist vision for his final two years in office and to set the terms of a debate that will sharpen the distinctions between the two parties in advance of the 2016 elections.
				</p>
				<p>He will argue for a new focus on the middle class, arguing that, "this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules." The president will also use the speech to urge Congress to pass legislation granting him authorization for the five-month-old military operation against the Sunni militant group the Islamic State.
